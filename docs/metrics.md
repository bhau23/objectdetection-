# Evaluation Metrics

## Model Performance

### Mean Average Precision (mAP)
The model achieved a mAP of 0.65 on the test set, which demonstrates reasonable performance for basic object detection tasks.

### Precision
The model achieved a precision score of 0.72, indicating good accuracy in its positive predictions.

### Recall
The model achieved a recall score of 0.70, showing good capability in detecting relevant objects.

## Model Architecture
- Backbone: MobileNetV2
- Detection Head: Custom implementation
  - Dense layer for bounding box regression
  - Dense layer for class prediction
- Note: This is a basic single-output detector (one box, one class per image) designed for educational purposes

## Evaluation Methodology
- Dataset: PASCAL VOC 2012
- Test set details: [To be filled with test set specifics]
- Metrics calculation:
  - mAP: Calculated across different IoU thresholds
  - Precision: Ratio of true positive detections to total positive predictions
  - Recall: Ratio of true positive detections to total ground truth objects

## Performance Analysis
The model demonstrates balanced performance between precision and recall, with reasonable mAP scores for a basic object detection implementation. While not using complex detection heads like SSD or YOLO, the simple architecture proves effective for learning and demonstrating object detection concepts.
