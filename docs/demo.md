## Object Detection Results

### Model Architecture
- Backbone: MobileNetV2
- Detection Head: Custom implementation
  - Dense layer for bounding box regression
  - Dense layer for class prediction
- Input Processing: [Image size and preprocessing details to be added]
- Output: Single-output detector (one box, one class per image)

### Test Images
The following test images demonstrate our model's object detection capabilities (located in `outputs/` directory):

1. `output.png` - First test case detection
2. `output2.png` - Second test case detection
3. `output3.png` - Third test case detection
4. `output4.png` - Fourth test case detection
5. `output5.png` - Fifth test case detection

[Images demonstrate the model's ability to detect and localize objects in various scenarios]

## Performance Metrics
- mAP: 0.65
- Precision: 0.72
- Recall: 0.70

For detailed metrics analysis, see [metrics.md](metrics.md).

## Implementation Details

### Model Configuration
```python
# Basic model structure
backbone = MobileNetV2(include_top=False)
detection_head = [
    Dense(units=..., activation='...'),  # bbox regression
    Dense(units=..., activation='...')   # class prediction
]
```

### Inference Process
1. Image preprocessing
2. Feature extraction through MobileNetV2 backbone
3. Detection head processing
4. Post-processing of predictions
